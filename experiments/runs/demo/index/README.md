This directory is populated by running `scripts/regenerate_demo_artifacts.py`.
The IVF-PQ index shards (`ivfpq.faiss`, `D_norm.npy`, and `ids.txt`) are generated
on demand and intentionally ignored from version control to keep the repository
small. See the README "Regenerating demo binaries" section for details.
